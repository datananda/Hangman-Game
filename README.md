A hipster-themed hangman game.

> Hangman was uncool before uncool was cool.

## Game Play

The game is played through keyboard input. Only letter keys are allowed, though you are not penalized for pressing other keys. The user tries to guess letters that appear in the currently selected hipster-themed word.

Thanks and credit for the excellent word selection goes to [Hipsum](https://hipsum.co/).

### Correct Guess

When a correct guess is made, the letter is revealed. If the last letter is revealed, the user wins a mustache badge and a new game starts automatically.

### Incorrect Guess

When an incorrect guess is made, the hipsterman dresses himself up with another hipster accessory. If 10 incorrect guesses are made, the hipster starts smoking a cigarette and a new game starts automatically.
